            <li>1 ⅓ cups water </li>
            <li>⅔ cup uncooked short-grain white rice </li>
            <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar </li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar </li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt </li>
            <li>4 sheets nori seaweed sheets </li>
            <li>½ pound imitation crabmeat, flaked </li>
            <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and sliced </li>
            <li>½ cucumber, peeled, cut into small strips </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons pickled ginger </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). </li>
            <li> Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. 
                Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. </li>
            <li> Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and set aside. </li>
            <li> Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet. </li>
            <li> Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes. </li>
            <li> Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top. 
                Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center. 
                Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a complete roll. 
                Repeat with remaining ingredients. </li>
            <li> Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices. </li>
        </ol>
